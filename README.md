# Exercise - Fake Shop TypeScript

## Description

In this project, you will modify the Fake Shop project that you did in the previous Mid Term by using TypeScript.

## Objectives

- Use TypeScript to create classes
- Once the project is compiled, the final result should be the same as the previous Mid Term
- Compiled JS files should be in the `dist` folder
- Source TS files should be in the `assets/scripts` folder
- In this project, you should use:
  - types,
  - private and protected properties,
  - readonly properties,
  - getters and setters,
  - inheritance,
  - abstract classes,
  - singletons classes

## Instructions

- Create a new branch for each step.
- Commit and push the changes after each step.
- Merge into master once the step is completed.

### Step 1 - Initialize the project

- In the configuration file, include `es6` as `target` and files shouldn't compile if there are errors.
- Set `strict` to `true`.
- Set the `dist` folder to store the compiled files.
- Set the `assets/scripts` folder to store the source files.

### Step 2 - Create the TypeScript files and copy the content of JS files

Follow this order, doing one file at a time:

- Product.ts
- ProductItem.ts
- ProductList.ts
- ShoppingCart.ts
- Shop.ts
- App.ts

> Only proceed to the next file once the previous one is working. No errors should be displayed in the console.
